	abstract = {The Hedonic Price Method ({HPM}), also known as hedonic regression, is used for estimating the value of a commodity or the demand for a commodity. The {HPM} has been extensively used in real estate and housing market research in the recent past. In this paper, we discuss theoretical and methodological developments related to hedonic regression and undertake an examination of use of this methodology in the recent real estate and housing literature. We first define the {HPM}, and explain the fundamentals behind the methodology. The idea behind the {HPM} is that the commodities are characterized by their constitute properties, hence the value of a commodity can be calculated by adding up the estimated values of its separate properties. In the second part of the paper, we emphasise that the heterogeneous nature of real estate property justifies the use of {HPM} for estimating their value or demand. We also take a stock of most cited empirical studies on real estate and housing using the {HPM}, and classify those into several categories. The classification indicates that neighbourhood characteristics of real estate are relatively over-researched as a determinant of price or rent. It also shows that implicit value of structural characteristics is under-researched. In general, implicit value of environmental amenities in the neighbourhood and air pollution are relatively overresearched. The effect of social factors, i.e. racial segregation and crimes on real estate value is under-researched. (authors's abstract)},

	abstract = {The paper examines the effect of flood risk regulation on property prices in the inner suburbs of Paris, France, over the period 2003 to 2012. We use unique data on property transactions and geo-localised amenities from a major European city exploiting the different dates of implementation of the flood risk zone regulation. Using an identification strategy based on a difference-in-differences specification, the results indicate that home prices for similar real estate are 3 to 7\% lower when located in a flood risk zone, depending on the sub market (flats or houses). The discount is higher, the higher is the flood risk designated by the regulation. Buyers' previous exposure to floods reduces the price discount.},

	abstract = {We develop a hedonic price model on the Gironde estuary (south of France) in order to test the impact of vulnerability to flooding on land prices. The original contribution of our analysis relies on distinguishing the respective impact of two non-structural measures on land prices - the preventive strategy consisting in a flood hazard zoning and the curative response to flood events consisting in orders for natural disaster to initiate financial compensation. This analysis is conducted on three different segments of land market (agricultural, vineyards and residential segments). We pay a particular attention to the respective importance of attractiveness factors from vulnerability ones to explain land price. We use a two-step method to estimate the model, starting with a semi-parametric model (based on the distance to the estuary) followed by a feasible generalized spatial two-stage least squares ({FGS}2SLS) with which we correct the model from spatial autocorrelation and endogeneity. Our main results indicate that both zoning measure and institutional response to vulnerability to flooding have a significant impact on prices, but in an opposite direction. We discuss the policy implications related to flooding prevention in regards to land use changes.},
